cross sum admittedly taken from 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14939953/sum-the-digits-of-a-number-python;
Description of what happens here and how I understand it after a few hours:
sum() for summing the iterable
int(digit) for digit in str(user_num) -> this is the iterable of sum(). 
digit recognizes the numbers in the string. 
int(digit) transforms the digits into integers.
for digit in str(user_num) iterates over the digits in the string just like 
Kr√∂mker iterated over the string "Python" in the lecture. Iteration happens
left to right. In conclusion, in this instance the built-in sum() function 
iterates over the strings of the input, which - if the input consists of 
numbers - results in the cross sum.
'''
cross_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(user_num_2))

#  Variables to maintain overview.
condition_division_3 = cross_sum % 3
condition_division_7 = user_num_2 % 7


#  if conditions to check for fizzbuzz.
#  Q: Why does 'if cross_sum / 3 == y for y in range(0, 10, 1):' not work?
if condition_division_3 == 0 and condition_division_7 == 0:
    print("fizzbuzz")
elif condition_division_3 == 0 and "7" in set(str(user_num_2)):
    print("fizzbuzz")
elif "3" in set(str(user_num_2)) and condition_division_7 == 0:
    print("fizzbuzz")
elif "3" in set(str(user_num_2)) and "7" in set(str(user_num_2)):
    print("fizzbuzz")
elif cross_sum % 3 == 0:
    print("fizz")
elif user_num_2 % 7 == 0:
    print("buzz")
elif "3" in set(str(user_num_2)):
    print("fizz")
elif "7" in set(str(user_num_2)):
    print("buzz")
else:
    print(user_num_2)
